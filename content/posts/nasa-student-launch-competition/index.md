## Formal Proposal

The [NASA Student Launch](https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/nasa-student-launch) competition is an annual event organized and hosted by NASA in which teams of engineers from universities around the United States compete to design, construct, and launch high-powered rockets. Teams submit a project proposal which must be accepted by NASA to be allowed to enter the competition. Each team must then provide comprehensive reports to NASA during the competition outlining their engineering progress to be allowed to remain in the competition, including a Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review, Flight Readiness Review, and Post-Launch Assessment Review. All of the details regarding the competition are provided in the handbook as shown below.

Part of the requirements for achieving the [Computer Engineering degree at Cedarville University](https://www.cedarville.edu/academics/programs/computer-engineering) include completing a senior design project. Successful completion of the project is evaluated by department faculty, who review our reports and presentations at the end of both semesters. My senior design project was working alongside two other electrical and computer engineering seniors to design, build, and test the payload for the Cedarville Student Launch (CSL) competition team. The full CSL team included eight mechanical engineers, one electrical engineer, and two computer engineers, along with faculty advisors.
